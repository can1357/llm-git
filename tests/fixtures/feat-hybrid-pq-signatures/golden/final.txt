feat(crypto): added Ed25519 hybrid signatures for quantum-safe transition

- Added Ed25519 hybrid signatures to ML-DSA 65 and SPHINCS+ 256f for post-quantum transition safety.
- Extended public keys, secret keys, and signatures to include both PQ and classical components.
- Updated verification to require both PQ and Ed25519 signature validation.
- Introduced HybridPublic, HybridSecret, and HybridSignature internal structs for composite key management.
- Added explicit length validation with descriptive errors during blob deserialization.
